Flashpunk boilerplate for new projects. Sort of a fusion of OO and script components I end up writing these days.

Toss Gentity inheritants into a GenWorld inheritant, add Script inheritants for the Gentity inheritant. See GenWorld's spawn() function and TestEntity for a silly but easily configurable example.
