Flashpunk boilerplate for new projects. Sort of a fusion of OO and script components I end up writing these days.

Toss Gentity descendants into a GenWorld descendant, add Script descendants for the Gentity descendant. Event-like script constructs such as always(x), when(x){y} and delay(n,x) are available to make life easier.

See GenWorld's spawn() function and the entities within for an easily configurable example, which results in this little game: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/75065952/fp-base.swf
